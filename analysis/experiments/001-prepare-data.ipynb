    "1. The first two paragraphs describing the need to omit sales in specific countries.\n",

    "2. If the user asks a customer-support-related question related to one of the no-sale countries, they should be given a description of the policy together with a country-specific explanation\n",
    "3. If the user asks specifically about the no-sale countries, they should be given a description of the policy, together with the list of no-sale countries\n",
